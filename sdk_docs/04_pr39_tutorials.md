## 1. SDK Integration Tutorial

**Purpose:** Demo day tutorial for complete SDK integration setup

### What You'll Learn

- Install and configure the Thenvoi SDK (Python or TypeScript)
- Set up and connect the Thenvoi MCP server to your AI coding assistant
- Connect agents and graphs built with LangGraph to Thenvoi
- Connect agents built with CrewAI to Thenvoi
- Use the MCP to interact with and manage your Thenvoi environment
- Test the system and identify areas for improvement

### Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Python 3.11+ or Node.js 18+
- Thenvoi account with API credentials
- AI coding assistant: Cursor, Claude Code, or Claude Desktop
- LangGraph installed (for LangGraph integration)
- CrewAI installed (for CrewAI integration)

**API Keys:**
- Thenvoi API key (from dashboard)
- OpenAI or Anthropic API key

### Tutorial Structure (5 Sections)

1. **SDK Installation and Setup** - Install SDK, configure credentials, verify
2. **MCP Installation and Connection** - Install MCP, connect to AI assistant
3. **Connecting External Agents** - LangGraph and CrewAI patterns
4. **Using MCP to Interact with Thenvoi** - Manage agents, chatrooms, executions
5. **Testing and Validation** - End-to-end testing, documentation

### Expected Outcomes

- Fully configured Thenvoi development environment
- Working SDK integration
- MCP connected to AI coding assistant
- Connected at least two external agents
- Created and used three chatrooms with external agents
- Made 5 different chats through MCP
- Feedback on SDK experience

3. **Stage 3: Add Custom Tools** - Learn to add calculator, weather tools
4. **Stage 4: Complex Sub-Graphs** - Wrap LangGraph workflows as tools
5. **Stage 5: Build Your Own Custom Agent** - Simple or full custom graph
6. **Creating Your Own Examples** - Template structure, best practices
7. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

### Key Features

- Detailed step-by-step instructions
- Code examples and templates
- Challenge exercises at each stage
- Comprehensive troubleshooting
- Quick reference guide
- Environment setup details

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Git access
- OpenAI API key

## Key Takeaways for SDK Documentation

### From SDK Integration Tutorial:
- Need clear 5-section structure for complete integration
- Cover both Python and TypeScript
- Include MCP as part of SDK experience
- LangGraph and CrewAI framework examples
- Testing and validation steps

### From LangGraph Workshop:
- Progressive complexity (simple → custom tools → sub-graphs → custom graph)
- Challenge exercises help learning
- Troubleshooting is essential
- Stage-based learning works well
- Include both built-in and custom approaches

## Content to Incorporate

1. **Installation guides** - Clear prerequisites, step-by-step setup
2. **Progressive tutorials** - Start simple, add complexity
3. **Multiple frameworks** - LangGraph (now), CrewAI (planned)
4. **Hands-on examples** - Working code that users can run
5. **Challenge exercises** - Practice reinforcement
6. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
7. **Testing validation** - How to verify everything works
